    "Many students are familiar with the notion of electric charge, but have little or no experience observing electrical effects first hand.  In this lab, you will have the opportunity to get this experience by using readily available materials.  You will be using Scotch Magic Tape to construct a low budget electroscope and to perform experiments that provide evidence for the following statements:\n",

    "There are two types of charge.\n",
    "Like charges repel.\n",
    "Unlike charges attract.\n",
    "The electric force between two charged objects depends strongly on the distance between them.\n",

    "### Procedure\n",
    "1) Tear off a 20 cm piece of tape and press it firmly to a tabletop or other flat surface, leaving one end of the tape sticking up as a handle. Quickly pull the tape from the table, suspending it in the air. While holding the tape, bring your finger near to the tape without touching it.  **Describe the interaction between your finger and the tape and  discuss why the interaction occurred.**"
